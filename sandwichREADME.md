Building the _perfect_ sandwich is as simple as 1, 2, 3! As in, follow these three steps below and you'll be well on your way to gastronomic heaven. 

Now, before you create your masterpiece and become the Earl of Sandwich, you'll need to have a vision of the greatness you're about to render. Things you might consider: 


* Mindset: What mood am I in and what mood do I want to be in? 
* Appetite: How hungry am I? Like, hungry? or hangry? 
* Setting: Is it a hot summer day, or a cold winter afternoon? 
* Timing: How much time do I have? Enough time to graduate as a Sandwich Artist, or I'm late for class but I need to eat _something_!


## 1. Bread selection
One of the most important steps is choosing your bread. Bread selection is so critical because it is the structure within which the rest of the ingredients reside. Think about it like a house -- you need a foundation, walls, and a roof to contain all the goodness of a home inside. The bread is the foundation, walls, and roof of your sandwich home. 

Some breads to consider (and they're best for)
* Sourdough (great for most sandiches, especially sandwiches you'll dip!)
* Rye (great compliment to strong-flavored fillings)
* Baguette (great for toasting, especially for grilled cheese)
* White bread (think Wonder Bread! Great for PB&J or simple bologna and cheese sammies)

> Tip: Too much bread to handle? If you're like me and cannot get through an entire loaf of bread before the hairy green goblin arrives (mold), **FREEZE IT**! Just pop the leftover loaf in the freezer to preserve it and thaw a couple slices at a time when you're ready. It'll be fresh and ready to go after a an hour or two. 

## 2. All about the fillings
What you choose to go inside largely depends on your answers to the *things to consider* questions above. For example, if I'm in a homebody, comfort food mood, on a cold winter day, and I'm mildly hungry and have some time to invest in the kitchen, I'll probably choose to go with a grilled cheese sandwich (with a side of tomato soup). 

Some ingredients to consider: 

```
- Protein (ham, turkey, chicken, beef, egg (fried egg or eg salad, perhaps?), portabello mushroom)

- Cheese (too many to list -- but my go to is a mild flavor so as not to overpower the rest of your fillings)

- Greens/vegetables (lettuce, spinach, sprouts, tomato, onion, pickle)

- Other fun stuff (avocado, peppers, cranberry sauce (that post-Thanksgiving turkey sandwich))
```

## 3. Mayo or Mustard - which condiment are you?
Don't forget the glue that binds it all together -- the condiment! Are you a mayo or mustard (or something else) person? There's no wrong answer. Just be sure you use enought to keep all the goodness from step 2 above in place! 

## 4. Construct the perfect sandwich
Now that you have chosen your bread, your fillings, and your condiment(s), let's bring your vision to life! Follow these *suggested* steps: 

- Prepare your bread (does it need to be sliced, toasted?)
- Apply your condiment to both slices of bread (face up)
- Layer in your fillings: 
    - Sturdy fillings first - I like to place meats, cheeses, etc. on both slices right after applying the condiments. 
    - Everything else in the midde - I'll layer in the rest of my fillings so that they are nested in a good place so as not to fall out when I take bites (though it's perfectly fine for your sandwich to fall apart -- part of the fun!) 
    - A note about Avocados: they are delicious and slippery. For a better avocado experience, I like to mash them up a bit versus slicing them. 

Now that you've read this tutorial, go and make the ***PERFECT*** sandwich.
